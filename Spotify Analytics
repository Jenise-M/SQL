# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What are the top ten most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#2 Determine the top 5 tracks with the highest average danceability.
SELECT 
track_name,
AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) desc
LIMIT 5;

#3 Which track had the longest duration?
SELECT track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#4. Who are the top 5 artists that have songs with the highest average energy?
SELECT 
artist_name,
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(energy) desc
LIMIT 5;

#5. Determine the average popularity, dancability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
