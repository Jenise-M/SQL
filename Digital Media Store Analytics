# For this project, I downloaded a digital media store dataset and used SQL to analyze and answer questions regarding the data.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.invoiceid, inv.invoicedate, inv.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
    LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
WHERE inv.billingcountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct billingcountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
    JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
    JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid;
    
#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, cust.firstname, cust.lastname, cust.country, inv.total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
    JOIN chinook.customers cust 
    ON inv.invoiceid=cust.customerid
    JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON cust.customerid=emp.employeeid;
    
#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.tracks t
    JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
    ON t.trackid=i.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, art.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
    LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
    ON i.trackid = t.trackid
    INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
    ON a.albumid = t.albumid
    LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art
    ON art.artistid = a.artistid;
    
#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT 
t.name AS 'track_name',
a.title AS 'album',
m.name AS 'media_type',
g.name AS 'genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
    JOIN chinook.media_types m
    ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
    JOIN chinook.genres g
    ON t.genreid = g.genreid
    JOIN chinook.albums a
    ON a.albumid = t.albumid;
    
#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT 
e.firstname,
e.lastname,
ROUND (SUM (i.total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.employees e
    JOIN chinook.customers c
    ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
    JOIN chinook.invoices i
    ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;
